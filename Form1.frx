ÿ¾     What this program does is this.  After you specify the Master and Compare File, the program will compare the 
two and will display everything in the compare file that is not in the master file.  The differnt lines will be in red.  
There is one fluke with the program I use Instr() to compare a line from the compare file to the whole master file, 
so repetitive keywords like End If, Else, and others like that are not displayed in red.  Sorry.  If you click on the 
compare or master panes the whole line will be highlight, to highlight more hold the shift key down and select 
more lines.  Use the traditional cut, copy, and paste commands to use those functions.  This program wasn't 
design to let you save, just copy changes into the VB IDE.  MAKE SURE YOU ONLY HGHLIGHT BLACK LINES WHEN JUMPING TO MASTER FILE, IF NOT PROGRAM CRASH WILL RESULT!!!
