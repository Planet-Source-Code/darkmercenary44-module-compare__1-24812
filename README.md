### Description

I designed this code for people that work on a VB project with someone else. This program will let you select a source file, and a master file. It will then highlight all the lines in red that aren't in the master file. Its usefull for if two coders are working on the same project, and you need to update your code to his without changing anything you may have added. Please click on the help button after you run it, it will give you some important info.
